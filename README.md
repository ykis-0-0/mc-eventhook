# What's this
A plugin which exposes EventHandler public APIs of PaperMC through Kotlin Script Engine

# How to use
1. Compile the project
2. Put it in the  `/plugins` folder of your PaperMC instance
3. Run the instance once and look for `/plugins/EventHook/config.kts`, or Find [`/src/main/resources/config.kts`](src/main/resources/config.kts), use it as reference and make one for yourself.
4. Done, i guess🤷🏿‍♂️
